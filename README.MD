![blockchain-introduction](G:\1.Code\===open source===\blockchain\blockchain-introduction.png)

> A blockchain is a constantly growing ledger which keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place in a secure, chronological, and immutable way.

Let's breakdown the definition,

- **Ledger:** It is a file that is constantly growing.
- **Permanent:** It means once the transaction goes inside a blockchain, you can put up it permanently in the ledger.
- **Secure:** Blockchain placed information in a secure way. It uses very advanced cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain.
- **Chronological:** Chronological means every transaction happens after the previous one.
- **Immutable:** It means as you build all the transaction onto the blockchain, this ledger can never be changed.
